Course: Applications Programming 
- Used Balsamiq wireframes to design a mobile application (Team Project)
- This is a quote manager mobile application to store and categorize quotes from the user
- From this project I learned how to design interfaces and how to use wireframes to create GUI
- From this team project I learned how to collaborate on a project and to share ideas to create a joint product
